    <p><strong>Our Taproom</strong></p>

    <p>The Hopps House Tap Room was designed and built with craft beer in mind. We hope our guests find as much enjoyment as we do in gathering among friends and neighbors over a pint of beer.
      Visit our tap room and see what’s on tap! Enjoy a fresh beer by the pint or a sampler glass. After you’ve decided which is your favorite beer, bring home a growler!
      See what we have on tap and bring a half-gallon growler of beer home to enjoy.
      Bring in your growler for a re-fill, or buy a new one for $6.</p>

      <p><strong>We offer FRESH. LOCAL. CRAFT. BEER.</strong></p>

      <p>We are passionate about brewing quality craft beer for our local communities.<br>Explore a variety of our worldly styles.</br></p>

      <p>A passion of the craft is what pulled us in and keeps us going. Hopps House has an earnest appreciation and respect for the craft lifestyle and the integrity and passion inherent in it. We believe that by sourcing high quality products as locally as possible, we are not only contributing to our community, but we are promoting a truly sustainable local environment.
