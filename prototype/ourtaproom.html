<h1>Our Taproom</h1>

<p>The Hopps House Tap Room was designed and built with craft beer in mind.
  We hope our guests find as much enjoyment as we do in gathering among
  friends and neighbors over a pint of beer.</p>

<p>Visit our tap room and see what’s on tap! Enjoy a fresh beer by the pint
  or a sampler glass. After you’ve decided which is your favorite beer, bring home a growler!
  See what we have on tap and bring a half-gallon growler of beer home to enjoy.
  Bring in your growler for a re-fill, or buy a new one for $6.</p>

<p>Growlers - $7
GROWLER CARE: Keep your beer cold and once the cap is removed, it's best to enjoy the beer
within the next several hours. Rinse-out the growler as soon as practical. When you have time,
soak in hot soapy water for a few minutes and use a brush to wash or shake vigorously. Drain and
rinse out a couple of times. Turn the growler upside down to drain. Dry and store with the cap off.
If your growler does not pass the quality control check (nose-check) when you bring it in, we'll
wash it on the spot to ensure the quality of your beer.</p>
